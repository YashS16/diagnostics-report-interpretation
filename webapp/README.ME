Attempting to build a web app to predict the possibility of having COVID from a X-Ray, for now it's pretty bare bone,

TO DO LIST:

* Make the background easier on the eyes(by making the background more transparent)
* Make the webapp more interactive
* Ballons?
* If we get to brain MRI should be able to switch between COVID and MRI
* Result store by default in Google
* Sources and copyright
